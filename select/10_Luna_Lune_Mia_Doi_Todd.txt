Luna lune, Luna lune
Let me see your other side.
One you never show to the world
Show to me.

Luna lune,
You are all reflection,
Sign, symbol, second nature.
Reveal yourself to me.

Luna lune, luna lune,
Lay down and deep with me
In silent space.

Here you come and go again.
Here you come and go again away.

Luna lune,
Let me see your other side.
One you never show to the world
Show to me.
